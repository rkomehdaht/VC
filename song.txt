The willow, it weeps today
A breeze from the distance
Is calling your name
Unfurl your black wings and wait
Across the horizons
It's coming to sweep you away
It's coming to sweep you away

Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird, fly away
May you never be broken again

The fragile can not endure
The wrecked and the jaded a place so impure
The static of this cruel world
Cause some birds to fly
Long before they've seen their day
Long before they've seen their day

Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird, fly away
May you never be broken again
Beyond the suffering you've known
I hope you find your way
May you never be broken again
