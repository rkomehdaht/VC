The willow, it weeps today
A breeze from the distance
Is calling your name
Unfurl your black wings and wait
Across the horizons
It's coming to sweep you away
It's coming to sweep you away

Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird, fly away
May you never be broken again

The fragile can not endure
The wrecked and the jaded a place so impure
The static of this cruel world
Cause some birds to fly
Long before they've seen their day
Long before they've seen their day

Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird, fly away
May you never be broken again
Beyond the suffering you've known
I hope you find your way
May you never be broken again

Ascend, may you find no resistance
Know that you made such a difference
And all you leave behind
Will live til the end

The cycle of suffering goes on
But the memories of you stay strong
Some day I too will fly
And find you again

Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird, fly away
May you never be broken again
Beyond the suffering you've known
I hope you find your way
May you never be broken again
May you never be broken again
